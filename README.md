# Service Failover System

## Introduction

The **Service Failover System** enhances the resilience of your application by providing robust mechanisms for handling failures in services. It ensures continuous operation through strategies like retry policies and circuit breakers.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Service Failover System is to minimize downtime and maintain the availability of your application by providing a failover mechanism for external and internal services. This system helps to ensure that your application can continue to operate smoothly, even in the face of service disruptions.

## System Components

The Service Failover System consists of several key components:

1. **Retry Policy**: Handles transient failures by retrying failed requests with configurable parameters such as maximum attempts and delay intervals.

2. **Circuit Breaker**: Monitors service health and prevents requests to unhealthy services, using parameters like failure thresholds and recovery times.

3. **Rate Limiter**: Manages the rate of outgoing requests to prevent service overloads and ensure compliance with rate limits.

4. **Connection Pool**: Optimizes connection management by reusing connections, reducing the overhead of establishing new ones.

5. **Cache**: Stores service responses to minimize requests and enhance performance.

6. **Metrics Collector**: Gathers performance and health metrics for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.8** or later
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- Internet access to install dependencies

## Installation

Follow these steps to install the package:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JacquesGariepy/service-failover.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd service-failover
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

After installation, configure the system:

- **Edit `config.ini`:**

  - Open the `config.ini` file located at the root of the project.
  - Configure parameters like API keys, base URLs, retry policy settings, circuit breakers, and rate limiters.

- **Set environment variables (optional):**

  - You can also define environment variables for sensitive settings.
  - For example in config.ini:

    ```plaintext
    API_KEY=your_api_key
    ...
    SERVICE1_BASE_URL=https://api.yourservice.com
    ...
    ```

## Getting Started

To use the Service Failover System, follow these steps:

1. **Configuration**: Set up parameters in the `config.ini` file or environment variables, including API keys, base URLs, and settings for retry policies, circuit breakers, and rate limiters.

2. **Service Registration**: Create instances of `APIService` and register them with the `FailoverManager` to manage failover for your services.

3. **Health Checks**: Implement health checks to ensure services are operational. The system will automatically handle any detected issues.

4. **Execute Requests**: Use the `FailoverManager` to make requests. It will handle retries, circuit breaking, and rate limiting automatically.

## Potential Use Cases

The Service Failover System can be used in various scenarios, including:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: In a microservices architecture, where multiple services interact with each other, the failover system can ensure that the application remains functional even if some services are down.

2. **API Gateway**: The failover system can be integrated into an API gateway to provide resilience and reliability for external API calls.

3. **Distributed Systems**: In distributed systems, where services are spread across multiple nodes, the failover system can help manage service failures and maintain system availability.

4. **Cloud Services**: When using cloud services, the failover system can handle transient failures and ensure that your application continues to operate smoothly.

## Best Practices

- **Monitor Metrics**: Regularly review metrics collected to identify and address potential issues early.
- **Fine-Tune Parameters**: Adjust configuration settings based on application needs and observed service behaviors.
- **Graceful Degradation**: Implement fallback mechanisms to maintain functionality when services are unavailable.

## Troubleshooting

- **Service Unavailability**: Check the circuit breaker status and service health indicators.
- **Performance Issues**: Analyze the metrics to identify bottlenecks or configuration issues.
- **Configuration Errors**: Ensure all settings in `config.ini` are correct and environment variables are properly set.

## Usage Examples

For a complete implementation example, please refer to the [call_api_services.py](examples/call_api_services.py) script located in the `examples` directory.

## Advanced Configuration

For more complex setups, you can customize various aspects of the Service Failover System:

- **Custom Circuit Breaker**: Define custom failure thresholds and recovery times.
- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Implement dynamic rate limiting based on service load.
- **Extended Metrics Collection**: Collect additional metrics for detailed analysis.

Refer to the documentation for detailed instructions on advanced configuration options.
