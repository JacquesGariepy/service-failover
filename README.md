# Service Failover System

## Overview

The Service Failover System is designed to provide a robust and reliable mechanism for handling failures in external and internal services. It ensures that your application can continue to function even when some services are unavailable or experiencing issues. The system employs various strategies such as retry policies, circuit breakers, and rate limiting to manage service failures effectively.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Service Failover System is to enhance the resilience and reliability of your application by providing a failover mechanism for external and internal services. This system helps to minimize downtime and maintain the availability of your application, even in the face of service disruptions.

## System Description

The Service Failover System consists of several key components:

1. **Retry Policy**: This component defines the strategy for retrying failed requests. It includes parameters such as the maximum number of attempts, base delay, and jitter to introduce randomness in the retry intervals.

2. **Circuit Breaker**: The circuit breaker monitors the health of services and prevents further requests to a service that is deemed unhealthy. It has configurable parameters such as failure threshold and recovery time.

3. **Rate Limiter**: This component controls the rate at which requests are sent to a service, preventing overloading and ensuring compliance with rate limits.

4. **Connection Pool**: The connection pool manages a pool of connections to services, allowing for efficient reuse of connections and reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.

5. **Cache**: The cache stores responses from services to reduce the number of requests and improve performance.

6. **Metrics Collector**: This component collects and exposes metrics related to the performance and health of services, providing valuable insights for monitoring and troubleshooting.

## Usage

To use the Service Failover System, follow these steps:

1. **Configuration**: Configure the system by setting the appropriate parameters in the `config.ini` file or environment variables. This includes API keys, base URLs, retry policy parameters, circuit breaker parameters, and rate limiter settings.

2. **Service Registration**: Register the services that you want to manage with the failover system. This can be done by creating instances of `InternalService` or `ExternalAPIService` and registering them with the `FailoverManager`.

3. **Health Checks**: Perform health checks on the registered services to ensure they are functioning correctly. The failover system will automatically handle unhealthy services by preventing further requests to them.

4. **Executing Requests**: Use the `FailoverManager` to execute requests to the registered services. The failover system will handle retries, circuit breaking, and rate limiting as needed.

## Example

Here is an example of how to use the Service Failover System:

```python
...
    retry_policy = RetryPolicy(max_attempts=MAX_ATTEMPTS, base_delay=BASE_DELAY, jitter=JITTER)
    circuit_breaker = CircuitBreaker(failure_threshold=FAILURE_THRESHOLD, recovery_time=RECOVERY_TIME)
    failover_manager = FailoverManager(retry_policy, circuit_breaker)

    services = [
        InternalService(base_url=config.get('SERVICES', 'SERVICE1_BASE_URL', fallback=os.environ.get('SERVICE1_BASE_URL', 'https://service1.example.com')), api_key=API_KEY),
        InternalService(base_url=config.get('SERVICES', 'SERVICE2_BASE_URL', fallback=os.environ.get('SERVICE2_BASE_URL', 'https://service2.example.com')), api_key=API_KEY),...
    ]

    for service in services:
        failover_manager.register_service(service)

    # Perform health checks
    for service in services:
        is_healthy = await service.health_check()
        if not is_healthy:
            print(f"Service {service.__class__.__name__} is unhealthy")

    try:
        result = await failover_manager.execute("/endpoint1", method='GET', params={'param1': 'value1'})
        print(result)

        ...

```

## Potential Use Cases

The Service Failover System can be used in various scenarios, including:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: In a microservices architecture, where multiple services interact with each other, the failover system can ensure that the application remains functional even if some services are down.

2. **API Gateway**: The failover system can be integrated into an API gateway to provide resilience and reliability for external API calls.

3. **Distributed Systems**: In distributed systems, where services are spread across multiple nodes, the failover system can help manage service failures and maintain system availability.

4. **Cloud Services**: When using cloud services, the failover system can handle transient failures and ensure that your application continues to operate smoothly.

## Conclusion

The Service Failover System is a powerful tool for enhancing the resilience and reliability of your application. By employing strategies such as retry policies, circuit breakers, and rate limiting, it ensures that your application can handle service failures gracefully and maintain availability. With proper configuration and usage, the failover system can significantly improve the robustness of your application in various scenarios.
